## Introduction
Simulating the bee-reproduction system by genetic algorithm 
The system is described as follow paper: https://qmplus.qmul.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/2537481/mod_resource/content/1/rsbl.2016.0188.pdf

## Details

* Python version: 3.8

## User Guide
1. Go to main.py 
2. Adjust the parameters
3. Directly run the main.py and it will output the result

## Result
* Graph of different's bees generation
* The simulated histogram result of bee's percentage
